# My lovely scripts and more
Things I use more or less.

#### [Help book](https://github.com/pr0gramista/godlike-scripts/tree/master/help_book)
Useful commands I usually forget after a while...

#### [Configs](https://github.com/pr0gramista/godlike-scripts/tree/master/configs)
Almost never up-to-date here. There are also some sw33t snippets.

#### [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) and [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/)
Some scripts here requires ffmpeg and/or youtube-dl to be on the path. These two always do a great job at handling YouTube.

#### Things you may need on Windows
Add this repository to your PATH and use `ls` or fix explorer by `explorer-reload`
